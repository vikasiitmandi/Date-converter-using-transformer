Dataset.py :
This code generates a dataset of fake dates in various formats, transforms them into one-hot encoded vectors suitable for training a neural network, and creates a data loader for batching the data.

modwl.py :
This code implements a Transformer model, consisting of positional encoding, scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and the complete encoder-decoder structure. The model is designed to process and generate sequences, with attention mechanisms allowing it to focus on different parts of the input sequence dynamically.
